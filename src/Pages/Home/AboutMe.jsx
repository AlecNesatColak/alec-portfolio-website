            I am a biomedical sciences graduate pursuing my second bachelor's
            degree in computer science. I hope to find synergy between my two
            degrees and work as a software engineer. I am a software
            engineer student at the University of Florida with a passion for learning and problem-solving. I am
            currently learning full-stack web development and have experience
            with Python, JavaScript, and Java. I am also familiar with React,
            Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am looking for opportunities to
            grow and develop my skills as a software engineer.
